# Flutter Riverpod Practise

In this project I am practising state management using Riverpod in Flutter.

## Install Rivepod

In the terminal, make sure you are in your project directory and run the following command to run the command below:
```Installing flutter_riverpod
$ flutter pub add flutter_riverpod
```
This will add the package to the `pubspec.yaml` file:
```
dependencies:
  flutter_riverpod: ^latest_version
```
